  "description": "A classic Western tale of two wandering cowpunchers who stumble into trouble in the small cow town of Oreana. Sad Sontag and Swede Harrigan arrive to bid on a ranch sale, but when they defend a young orphan named Speck from a bullying rancher, they find themselves drawn into something more complicated than a simple auction. As they wait for the Bar S Ranch sale—a property lost to drink and debt—the two partners begin to sense something suspicious about the circumstances. With its quick-draw action, colorful characters, and the code of the Old West, this adventure promises gunplay, mystery, and the kind of justice that comes from standing up for what's right.",
